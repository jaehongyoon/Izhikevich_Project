# Izhikevich_Project
Github for BME513 Project (Jaehong Yoon &amp; Zhongxi Li) 

This project aims to explore the parameter setting of the Izhikevich neuron 
model so that the latter can exhibit "memory" function.

Specifically, we are aiming at three milestones:
1) develop tools for finding bifurcation typs of the Izhikevich model.
2) find, by genetic algorithm, the suitable parameters that render memory feature of single (or more connected) neurons.
3) find features of these obtained paramters via bifurcation analysis in 1).
